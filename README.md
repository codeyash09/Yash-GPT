Hi! Im Yash

I wanted to make an slm and trained it on kid's stories...

I would have uploaded my "trained" weights too but github would not allow me to upload files that large.


The new code does not have that many comments on a lot of it because most of the code is from before and if you check the commented out segments, you will likely find explantations behind most of the code.
